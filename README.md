# Website-ranking
Toy example on how websites are ranked on the web


@author Erodotos Demetriou

This assignment lunches 3 separate programs. The first one compares 2 files and present their differences.
The second one implements a simple host rank algorithm and the thirld one prints the distance between 2
strings.

How to use
-----------

   Subject 1

   The program takes as input at least 2 commandline arguments. 2 files to compare. Also the program can take optional inputs which offer further functionalities to the user.
   These are : /nc (no capitals) /s (print first and last line between non equal lines) /ln (print line numbers).

   Subject 2

   The program takes as input at least 2 commandline arguments. The files names which contain the hosts data. 

   Subject 3

   The program takes as input at least 2 commandline arguments. The files names which contain the strings we want to compare.

I found this project interesting but challenging at the same time. Although, 
i faced some issues reading the files. Some files had windows configurations
and on linux are not operated in a proper way. For example, in file dna2.txt
there is an extra windows new line character which linux can not find. For 
this reason, the output for this program is 3 instead of 2 for input files
dna1.txt and dna2.txt.

PS:

Dear Progammer:
   
   When i wrote this code, only god and I knew how it worked.
   Now, only god knows it!

   Therefore, if you are trying to correct or optimize this 
   program and it fails (most surely), please increase this 
   counter as a warning for the next person:

   counter = 1;
